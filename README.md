App Flow

Splash Screen

Shown at app startup with a small delay.

Automatically navigates to the Welcome Screen.

Welcome Screen

Two actions available:

Get Started â†’ navigates to Signup Screen.

Sign In â†’ navigates to Login Screen.

Signup Screen

User provides name, email, password.

Validations:

All fields required

Email must not be empty and should contain @

Password must be at least 6 characters

Data is stored securely in AsyncStorage (@user)

After signup, a session (@session) is also created.

Login Screen

User enters email and password.

Credentials are validated against the saved signup data in AsyncStorage.

If data matches â†’ user is logged in and redirected to Home Screen.

If not â†’ an alert is shown: Incorrect credentials.

Home Screen (with Bottom Tabs)

After successful login, user lands on the Home screen.

Bottom Tab Navigation includes:

Home

Profile

Settings

Custom tab icons are loaded from src/assets/images.

Logout

Clears only the session (@session), not the saved user (@user).

Redirects back to the Welcome screen.

Tech Used

React Native CLI

React Navigation (Stack + Bottom Tabs)

Context API for managing authentication state

AsyncStorage for storing user and session data

Custom Components: AppButton, AppInput, AppText

Custom Tab Icons from src/assets/image

Notes

A user must sign up first before logging in.

Session persists across app restarts using AsyncStorage.

Logout only ends the session; the registered user remains saved.
